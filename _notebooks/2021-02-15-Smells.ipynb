    "Our olfactory system have a remarkable capacity to distinguish [about 1 trillion smells](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/343/6177/1370) :open_mouth:! We are usually not thankful for that, but mother nature has given us an enormous gift. It is a product of hundreds of thousands of years of evolution that helped us to survive in less prosper times. It has helped us to find good food, and avoid dangerous situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, modern human badly rely on their nose for the purpose of nutrition. When we go to a market we don't need to smell or taste the food to gather information about it. All information we need is written the plastic packing which involves the food we buy: calories, fat, sugar, expiration date. \n",
    "\n",
    "**So what is the role of our nose for the modern human?** **Is It just for us to lay our glasses on? Or hang piercings? Or for us to complain about its irregular shape when taking selfies?**  \n",
    "You may argue that you could easily survive without your nose and our remaining senses are much more important (vision, hearing, tasting), and I can't disagree. \n",
    "\n",
    "It seems that we do not need our nose for surviving nowadays, but good smells can have a **huge influence** on our behaviour and companies take **real** advantage of that when trying to sell you things. Consider a simple product which is an essential part of our daily life (now even more during covid pandemics): **a bar of soup**. There are hundreds of soap brands in a regular market. They all do the cleaning job pretty well. You may have tested a lot of them and I'm pretty sure you finished washing your hands and did not complain about the soap capacity to remove dirt. So what do guide your decision when you buy a bar of soap and other self-care products? \n",
    "\n",
    "I can't avoid sharing my experience: I always smell the soap before buying it and I always choose the one with the most pleasant smell. It is one of the only products in the market you can experience before buying and a lot of people take advantage of that. The same is valid for shampoos, deodorants, cosmetics and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The products I mentioned are part of what people call fragranced functional products. They serve a given purpose (cleaning for shampoos) but contain fragrances to either improve customer acceptance or mask unpleasant odours. There are also another class of fragranced products: **Perfumes!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike shampoos, perfumes have no other purpose than be perceived. The word perfume comes from the Latin phrase, “per” meaning “through” and “fumus” meaning “smoke”. The French later gave the name “parfum” to the smells produced by burning incense. Some perfumes are made to be released in the air and give a confined space a certain olfactory \"personality\". Similarly, perfumes are also used by humans to give themselves olfactory personality - **with fragrances!**"

    "The sense of smell is built by cooperation between our nose and our brain. When a chemical component is present in the air and we sniff it, the chemical travel through our nostrils and reach our olfactory receptor cells in the nasal epithelium. If any of the receptor cells is \"receptive\" to that chemical and it is present in a detectable amount, it will send an electrical signal for our brain through our neurons. That signal is then processed by our brain creating the conscious experience of smell. Here is a picture I took from the web to summarize it."

    "Perfumes are a liquid mixture of chemical components designed to cause a desired olfactory impression when released in the air.

Perfumers (people who make perfumes) use semantic descriptors to classify perfume ingredients. \"Semantic descriptors\" are just a fancy way to say \"words\". So, perfumers use words to classify perfume ingredients. Let me give you an example I took from [this website](http://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/) that contains a list of hundreds of perfume ingredients.   "
