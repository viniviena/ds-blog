<p style="font-size: 22px;"> This site is my personal blog for hosting my research projects. In case you are asking yourself what is process systems engineering (PSE): It is branch of industrial engineering and a interdisciplinary field. It covers process design, system modeling and simulation, dynamics and control, process analytics, optimization, and economic. Here I will provide code (mostly Python) for solving "pure" machine learning problems and machine learning applied to PSE. </p>
