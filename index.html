<p style="font-size: 22px;"> This site is my personal blog for hosting my research projects. 
      In case you are asking yourself what is process systems engineering (PSE): It is branch of industrial engineering and a interdisciplinary field. 
      It covers process design, system modeling and simulation, dynamics and control, process analytics, optimization, and economic. 
      Here I will provide code (mostly Python) for solving traditional machine learning problems and machine learning applied to PSE. 
      I hope you enjoy the visit and find something useful for your own creations. </p>
